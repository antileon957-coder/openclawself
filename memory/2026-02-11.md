# Daily Log: 2026-02-11

## 📝 Key Context
- Successfully established the "Context Health Check" protocol in `HEARTBEAT.md` to prevent token spikes.
- Validated the "Targeted/Sequential Dispatch" (精准下发) model for sub-agents to mitigate task escape and optimize TPM.
- Clarified the workspace distinction: Active is `~/.openclaw/workspace` (Memory-driven), while `~/Documents/Anti/openclaw/data/workspace` is the "Sentinel" (Code-coupled/Defensive) variant.

## ✅ Completed Actions
- [x] **Heartbeat Upgrade**: Added logic to detect context overflow (>70% or >1M tokens) and alert the user with a summary.
- [x] **Sub-agent Test**: Successfully ran a 3-step retrieval task using highly specific micro-instructions, proving better precision and cost-efficiency than broad commands.
- [x] **Protocol Refinement**: Updated `STANDARDS.md` and `HEARTBEAT.md` to silence non-actionable heartbeat logs while keeping alert functionality.
- [x] **Documentation Retrieval**: Parsed official Heartbeat docs and GitHub releases (v2026.2.9) to stay aligned with the latest core improvements.

## 🧠 Insights & Lessons
- **Context Management**: Proactive "Context Overload Warning" is critical for avoiding the 1.4M TPM spike encountered previously.
- **Dispatching Philosophy**: Pro models should be used for "Logic Depth" rather than "Input Breadth." High-volume IO tasks should be filtered by Flash or segmented by specific instructions.
- **Timezone Awareness**: Log timestamps are UTC (Zulu), requiring a +8h offset for Asia/Shanghai (objective world time).

## ⚙️ Updated Protocols
- **Memory Maintenance**: Only report gardening results if changes occur; otherwise, remain silent (`HEARTBEAT_OK`).
- **Sentinel Comparison**: Identified that the "Sentinel" project likely employs a more rigid, defensive soul compared to "小O"'s partner/growth-oriented persona.

## ⏭️ Pending / Next Steps
- Monitor the first automatic "Context Health Check" during the next heartbeat cycle.
- Investigate the "Resource deadlock" on the Anti/ project files if further comparison is needed.
